# The Mathematics and Statistics of Infectious Disease Outbreaks

![](Assets/SUlogo_small.png)

Repository for the MT3002 summer 2020 course on "The Mathematics and Statistics of Infectious Disease Outbreaks" given at the [Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden](https://www.math.su.se), by [Tom Britton](https://staff.math.su.se/tom.britton/) and [Michael Höhle](https://staff.math.su.se/hoehle). 

### Pre-requisites for the course 

Undergraduate knowledge of mathematics (e.g. differential equations, optimization) and statistics (e.g. random variables, distributions, maximum likelihood inference) as well as some programming skills in a language with a data science component (python, R, Julia, matlab, ...).

Audience for the 2020 course were B.Sc. students in the natural science (statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, ...), but we hope the material is also of interest for others, e.g., Ph.D. students in the field of epidemic modelling, infectious disease epidemiologists with a like for the quantitative side of matters, and for those who just want to improve their armchair epidemiology skills.

## Video Lectures

The video lectures are publicly available from a corresponding [channel](https://video.su.se/channel/The%2BMath%2Band%2BStats%2Bof%2BInfectious%2BDisease%2BOutbreaks/356471) at the [video server](https://video.su.se) of Stockholm University (don't forget to unmute the video). For a better distributed access, the lectures are also available from a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl_ncesshp_C-URStf-LwhYCbFGE70_jq).

Lectures were given in flipped classroom mode during July (L1-L7) and August (L8-L12) of 2020. The recordings below served as preparation for an live Zoom meeting (not recorded), where we discussed the content of the lectures.
